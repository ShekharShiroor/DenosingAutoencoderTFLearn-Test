# DenosingAutoencoderTFLearn-Test

The project demonstrates implementation of a convolutional autoencoder which attempts to deblur the images given to it as input. 

The dataset used for this project is MNIST.

The  wrapper for deep learning framework Tensorflow, TFLearn is used to implement this project.
