# DenosingAutoencoderTFLearn-Test

The project demonstrates implementation of a convolutional autoencoder which attempts to deblur the images given to it as input. 

The dataset used for this project is MNIST.

TFLearn wrapper for deep learning framework Tensorflow is used to implement this project.
